# Arduino-Hand-Firmware
This code allows the user to send information from a computer via Serial and send it to some servos which will move accordingly.
It is recommended the usage of our driver to receive this data from your API.

This code was created for the project Shaking Hands Overseas. We are a group of students in CIC Baxtillerats in Barcelona, who want to move a biomechanical hand without the need of sharing spaces.
